I'm posting my solutions to Harvard's CS50 Assignments.

Make sure you have completed your own assignment before looking other's answers as it might break the academic honesty.

After checking don't worry if yours seems just like mine in shape (it's an algorithm, order matters) and names (really, cs50 pages suggests a lot of names). There are exercises that make you think a certain way and thinking outside the box isn't a course requirement (though it's encouraged), so people that read the same explanation at their page tend to solve these problems the same way.

Stay safe
